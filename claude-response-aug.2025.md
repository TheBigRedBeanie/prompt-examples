**Code Example**:
```javascript
// AI-Enhanced Playwright Test
// Copilot generates comprehensive selectors and validations
test('User login with enhanced validations', async ({ page }) => {
  // AI-suggested resilient selectors
  await page.locator('[data-testid="username-input"]').fill(testData.validUser.username);
  // AI-generated comprehensive assertions
  await expect(page.locator('.dashboard-welcome')).toContainText('Welcome');
  await expect(page.locator('[aria-label="User menu"]')).toBeVisible();
});
```

### 5. Regression Testing Intelligence

**Current State**: QA executes regression tests across test, staging, and production environments

**AI Enhancement with Copilot**:
- **Risk-Based Test Selection**: AI analyzes code changes to prioritize regression test execution
- **Environment-Specific Scenarios**: Generates environment-appropriate test variations
- **Failure Pattern Analysis**: Identifies recurring failure patterns and suggests preventive tests

**PowerPoint Blurb**: *"Smart regression testing - Copilot predicts where bugs hide, focusing your testing firepower where it matters most."*

**Strategic Implementation**:
- Use AI to analyze git diff and suggest affected test areas
- Generate environment-specific smoke tests
- Create predictive test suites based on historical failure data
